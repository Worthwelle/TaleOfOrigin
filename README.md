**Your Family, Your Tale:** A genealogy software focusing on creating and
sharing your family's unique story.

## Project Goal

The goal of the Tale of Origin project is to create a tool to track not
only the branching of a family tree, but also to keep the family
history organized, accessible and interesting. To this goal, Tale of
Origin strives to provide a realistic representation of a family tree
without the restrictions presented by many simplified or moralistic
family tree software.

### Organized

### Accessible

### Interesting

### Free

Tale of Origin is open source software. What you see is what you get.

### Milestones

#### Alpha

It should be assumed that upgrading from one alpha version to a new alpha version will break the database.

**0.1** - A functioning API implementing the features that will be the foundation of the software.

**0.2** - An enhanced HTML5 web interface utilizing AngularJS to add fluidity to existing features.

**0.3** - Introduce administrator and moderator roles in API and web. (Mostly behind the scenes.)

#### Beta

Current beta code will be hosted live for testing, but will not be available on the [official website](http://taleoforigin.com/).

**0.5+**

Documentation will, eventually, be available in the development repository.
